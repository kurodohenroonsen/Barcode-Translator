## üåü Introduction  

Welcome to the **Barcode Translator Extension**, a next-generation tool designed to bridge the gap between product data and consumer understanding. Whether you're scanning a food item or exploring non-food products, this extension seamlessly extracts GTINs (Global Trade Item Numbers) from barcodes and delivers concise, accessible, and multilingual information.  

Imagine having a personalized digital assistant that not only deciphers product details but also shares computationally expensive results through decentralized platforms like Archive.org for reuse. Inspired by the legendary work of Saint Isidore of Seville, this project catalogs product information like an encyclopedia, where **GTINs replace words in the index**.
